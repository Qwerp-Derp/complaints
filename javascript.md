# JavaScript

These are the things I hate about JavaScript:

- Loads of different frameworks for everything. This is completely unnecessary IMO.
  
  For example, here's a (non-exhaustive) list of frameworks for developing webapps:
  - React
  - Angular
  - Vue
  - Meteor
  - Ember
  - Aurelia
  - Backbone
  
  Here's a (also non-exhaustive) list of frameworks for module systems:
  - Browserify
  - Webpack
  - Require.js
  - System.js
  
  Here's yet another (again, non-exhaustive) list of frameworks for developing native apps:
  - React Native
  - Electron
  - Angular Native
  - PhoneGap
  - NativeScript
  - Ionic
  
  Why do you have to do this to me, JS? This puts off developers from ever using a framework in the first place. Which one do I choose? As well as that, JS frameworks have extremely short shelf-lives - within a few years, sometimes even a few months, these frameworks become irrelevant or extinct.

  Also, framework devs, what's the point of doing this? No one wins if you keep churning out more and more frameworks - the usage of your framework gets diluted.
  
- No module system.

  This point essentially enforces a "one-file philosophy" for JS - when doing front-end stuff, you have to either do a metric ton of `<script>` tags, you have to use one file to put everything in, or you have to use one of the terrible frameworks for module systems, which clutter up your code and take up valuable space.
