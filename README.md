# Qwerp-Derp's complaint corner
A page of just me complaining about various languages. No language is safe from badness, but by complaining about things which I (and hopefully other people) don't like, we can shine a light and improve on those points.

***Note**: For all of you butthurt fanboys out there, this is my opinion. Just in case none of you guys realise.*

## Proposed items to add:
- Clojure:
    - confusing stack traces
    - slight inconsistencies (see `cons` and pals)
    - uses JVM, which therefore inherits some of Java's problems
- Kotlin:
    - stupid syntax for initialising arrays (`intArrayOf` and friends)
- Rust:
    - stupid ownership rules
- Dart:
    - terrible support for C/C++ bindings, it's literally impossible to do anything on desktop outside of simple command-line apps
    - literally no point to type restraints: it's slower to include them than to exclude them
- Python:
    - terrible syntax for OOP: awful class extension, lack of private/protected methods
